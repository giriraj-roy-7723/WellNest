Fever is a temporary rise in body temperature, often due to infection. 
For adults, a temperature above 100.4째F (38째C) is considered a fever. 
Mild fevers can help the body fight infection. 
Seek medical care if fever persists for more than 3 days, exceeds 103째F (39.4째C), or is accompanied by confusion, stiff neck, chest pain, or breathing difficulties.
